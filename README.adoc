== Overview

The following works:

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/ajneu/cmake_project_via_macro.git
cd                                 cmake_project_via_macro
git checkout 5972c7362e11fdbaa09d9defe8cca2dcea79e606   ## intermediate commit

mkdir build
cd    build
cmake -DCOMPILER_SEL=clang ..
----

But the following does **not** work as expected:
[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/ajneu/cmake_project_via_macro.git
cd                                 cmake_project_via_macro
git checkout master     ## last commit

mkdir build
cd    build
cmake -DCOMPILER_SEL=clang ..
----

The only difference is https://github.com/ajneu/cmake_project_via_macro/commit/545a7c5e573f4d6cb2ca50ef229cfc0c80a24398[here], where `myproject` is a macro defined in an included file (https://github.com/ajneu/cmake_project_via_macro/blob/master/myproject.cmake[ref]).
